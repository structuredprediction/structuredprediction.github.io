Many prediction tasks in NLP involve assigning values to mutually
dependent variables. For example, when designing a model to
automatically perform linguistic analysis of a sentence or a document
(e.g., parsing, semantic role labeling, or discourse analysis), it is
crucial to model the correlations between labels. Many other NLP
tasks, such as machine translation, textual entailment, and
information extraction, can be also modeled as structured prediction
problems. 

In order to tackle such problems, various structured prediction
approaches have been proposed, and their effectiveness has been
demonstrated. Studying structured prediction is interesting from both
NLP and machine learning (ML) perspectives. From the NLP perspective,
syntax and semantics of natural language are clearly structured and
advances in this area will enable researchers to understand the
linguistic structure of data. From the ML perspective, the large
amount of available text data and complex linguistic structures bring
challenges to the learning community. Designing expressive yet
tractable models and studying efficient learning and inference
algorithms become important issues.

Recently, there has been significant interest in non-standard
structured prediction approaches that take advantage of non-linearity,
latent components, and/or approximate inference in both the NLP and ML
communities. Researchers have also been discussing the intersection
between deep learning and structured prediction through the DeepStructure reading group.  
This workshop intends to bring together NLP and ML researchers working
on diverse aspects of structured prediction and expose the
participants to recent progress in this area. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to, the following:


*  Efficient learning and inference algorithms.
*  Joint inference and learning approaches.
*  Learning to search for NLP.
*  Latent variable models.
*  Integer linear programming and other modeling techniques.
*  Structured prediction for deep learning models.
*  Deep learning and neural network approaches for structured prediction.
*  Structured prediction software.
*  Structured prediction applications in NLP.
*  Approximate inference for structured prediction.


### Submissions

We invite the following two types of papers:

*  Paper describing original, solid, and scientific research work related to structured learning in NLP.
*  Tutorial paper on structure prediction methods and/or applications. 

All submissions must follow EMNLP 2016 formatting requirements, and they must be in PDF.
Papers should be less than *8 pages* in length. References do not count against this limit. 
The page limit serves as a guideline and will not be strictly enforced.
The official style files are available at 
[Official ACL style files (zip)](http://acl2016.org/files/acl2016.zip)

Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference should be avoided as well. 

Submission is electronic and is managed by the START conference management system at
[https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2016/SPNLP/]()


Each submission will be reviewed by at least 2 program committee members. 



### Important Dates

* Aug 20: submission deadline (about a week after the EMNLP 2016 acceptance notification)
* Sep 5: acceptance notification (about a month after the submission)
* Sep 26: camera ready (3 weeks after the notification)
